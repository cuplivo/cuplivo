# Cuplivo Domain Glossary

## Title Preset System
- **Hash Fingerprint matching**: `detect()` uses `trim()` only (conservative), exact character match after stripping leading/trailing whitespace.
- **PromptPreset data class**: `id`, `label`, `prompt` fields only. No `recommendedThinking` — presets are style-only, Thinking is independently controlled.
- **Dirty state**: real-time `detect()` on every text change; dropdown label switches to "自定义" when content no longer matches any preset.

## UI Interaction Model
- **Desktop** uses `DesktopSelectDropdown<String>` with `__custom__` sentinel for unmatched prompts.
- **Mobile** opens a `showModalBottomSheet` with `IosCardPress` options.
- Both are wrapped in `ListenableBuilder(controller)` so the dropdown label updates immediately on preset click or text edit, without auto-saving.
- "重置全部" button: resets both prompt text (`resetTitlePrompt()`) and Thinking switch (`resetTitleGenerationThinkingEnabled()`). No separate [↺] on the Thinking row.

## Title Generation Prompts

- **emojiTitlePrompt**: A preset variant of the title generation system prompt that allows ONE relevant emoji at the beginning of the title (followed by a space). No other punctuation or special characters are permitted elsewhere. The character limit (≤10) excludes the emoji.

## SVG Rendering in Chat

- **SVG code block** (` ```svg `): rendered via `SvgCodeBlock` widget (tab UI: "SVG" image tab + "Code" tab, reuses `mermaidImageTab`/`mermaidCodeTab` ARB keys). Uses `SvgPicture.string()` to render inline SVG XML. No streaming support (streaming SVG fragments are almost always invalid XML).
- **Markdown image SVG**: `imageBuilder` detects `.svg` extension in URL and `data:image/svg+xml;base64,...` pattern, routes to `SvgPicture.network()` or `SvgPicture.string()` respectively.
- **Known limitation**: URLs without `.svg` extension (e.g. shields.io badges like `https://img.shields.io/badge/release-1.0.0-blue`) are not detected as SVG. The user must ensure LLM output includes `.svg` suffix, or append it manually. Deliberate trade-off: avoids an extra failing HTTP request for every extensionless URL.

## Input Draft Persistence

- **InputDraftPersistence**: `lib/features/home/services/input_draft_persistence.dart`. Owns debounced (800ms) writes + lifecycle immediate save of chat input draft via `SharedPreferences`.
- **Scope**: Single global draft (`chat_draft_v1` key). Not per-conversation — the input is shared across conversations.
- **Persistence**: JSON blob with `{text, images[], documents[{path,fileName,mime}]}`.
- **Restore**: On cold start only, in `_ChatInputBarState._restoreDraft()`. Sets `TextEditingController.text` + media lists.
- **Clear**: On send success or when input is fully empty. Debounce skips empty content.

## Incremental Backup (Experimental)

- **Data scope**: Chat data (conversations + messages + toolEvents + geminiThoughtSigs). Optionally includes files (upload/, images/, avatars/, fonts/) when `includeFiles=true`, filtered by mtime >= since.
- **Filtering unit**: Message-level (`message.timestamp >= since`). Conversations created before `since` are still included if they have recent messages; only those messages are exported. Uses `updatedAt` as a fast pre-filter to skip inactive conversations. See `docs/adr/0002-conversation-level-incremental-filtering.md`.
- **File naming**: `cuplivo_incr_<export_ts_YYYYMMDD-HHmmss-ffffff>_<since_ts_YYYYMMDD-HHmmss>.zip`. The `cuplivo_incr_` prefix is the single identification mechanism for the restore path.
- **Restore behavior**: `cuplivo_incr_` prefix detected → skip the "Overwrite/Merge" dialog entirely → force `RestoreMode.merge` at both UI and DataSync layers.
- **Date source**: `BackupReminderProvider.lastBackupTime` for the [↻] shortcut. If null, fallback to 30 days ago. User can always override via `showDatePicker()`.
- **`includeSettings`**: Default `true`. Not yet persisted (planned for a future PR).
- **`includeFiles`**: Default follows the config's `includeFiles` toggle. Files are filtered by `lastModifiedSync() >= since`. Not persisted.
- **Architecture**: Incremental backup is NOT a mode toggle on full backup — it's a separate independent action. `BackupProvider.incrementalBackup(IncrementalBackupConfig)` and `S3BackupProvider.incrementalBackup(IncrementalBackupConfig)` are new methods that don't modify existing `backup()`.
- **UI placement**: Desktop & Mobile. Each target (WebDAV, S3, Local) gets its own incremental section within its existing card, with date picker + [↻] shortcut + settings toggle + includeFiles toggle + separate action button.
- **User-visible behaviors**:
  - Export filename always starts with `cuplivo_incr_`
  - Export includes settings if `includeSettings=true`, includes files if `includeFiles=true` (filtered by mtime)
  - Import automatically skips mode selection for `cuplivo_incr_` files
  - Empty export (0 conversations matched) shows a confirmation warning before producing the file

## Multi-AI Comparison Mode (Side-by-side)

- **Trigger**: 
  - **User messages**: No entry point.
  - **Assistant messages**: MessageMoreSheet "Multi AI" action → "让其他 AI 也回答". Uses pre-selected models from model selector; if none pre-selected, opens multi-model selector via `showMultiModelSelector()`. Comparison starts **immediately** via `startRoundFromHistory()`.
  - **Model selector**: Dual-mode (single/multi) in `_ModelSelectSheet`. Select ≥2 models → 确定 → enters multi-AI mode via `multiAIEngine.enter()`.
- **Data model**: `ChatMessage.subgroupId` (nullable TEXT). Within the same `groupId`, multiple `subgroupId`s represent different model responses as **cards**. `subgroupId = null` messages follow existing collapse/version behavior.
- **Card rendering**: When a `groupId` has any message with `subgroupId != null`, render cards (PageView) instead of a single collapsed message. Each card shows one subgroup's selected version using full `ChatMessageWidget`.
- **Resolve (adopt)**: ALL threads across ALL rounds get `subgroupId = NULL`, reassigned continuous versions, adopt version stored in `versionSelections[groupId]`. Exits card mode. Exits multi-AI engine mode.
- **Drop**: A single thread's messages get `subgroupId = NULL` (keeping version), exits that card but stays in version pool. Model pool shrinks by 1 via `removeThread()`. Physical DB rows unchanged.
- **Streaming**: N concurrent streams, each writing to their own messageId. Existing `StreamingContentNotifier` per-message architecture handles this.
- **Engine state** (MultiAIEngine, in-memory only): `_models`, `_threadIds`, `_isActive`. NOT persisted — recovery happens from `ChatMessage.subgroupId` + `providerId`/`modelId` in conversation history.
- **Persistence recovery**: On conversation switch via `switchConversationAnimated`, scan `_messages` for `subgroupActiveGroupIds`, extract `{providerId, modelId}` from latest round's subgroup messages, restore model selector badge via `multiAIEngine.recoverFromMessages()`.
- **Mode lifecycle**:
  - Enter: Select ≥2 models → 确定. Or: assistant message "更多" + trigger.
  - Lock: Once active, model selector button is locked → shows pill badge with ✕ and model count. Click shows snackbar "多 AI 模式已激活".
  - Exit: Click ✕ on badge, resolve (adopt), deselect to 1 model, switch conversation.
  - Drop: Reduces model pool synchronously via `removeThread()`.
- **Model selector interaction**:
  - Normal: single-select (existing behavior).
  - Multi-select mode: checkboxes in `_ModelSelectSheet` + 确定 button. Long-press still opens ProvidersPage.
  - When N≥2 selected → enter multi-AI mode.
  - When locked: click → snackbar toast.
- **Send behavior**: When multi-AI mode active, typing send triggers `startRound` for ALL models (N parallel threads).
- **startRoundFromHistory**: Called when user clicks "让其他 AI 也回答". Finds preceding user message, assigns it `roundGroupId` (persisted via `chatService.updateMessage` with `groupId`), creates N assistant placeholders with `subgroupId`s, starts N streams using conversation history as API context. No new user message created.
- **UI**: `MultiAICardGroup` with PageView (horizontal swipe). Card has Resolve ✓ / Drop ✕ per card. `ChatInputBar` retained with badge `{count} 个模型` and ✕ button.

## Image Attachment Compression

- **Trigger**: Per-image via clicking file size label below thumbnail; batch via dialog's "全部压缩" button. All ingress paths (gallery, camera, file picker, drag-and-drop, clipboard paste) treated identically.
- **Dialog**: `ImageCompressionDialog` in `lib/shared/dialogs/image_compression_dialog.dart`. Follows incremental backup pattern: `show()` for desktop (centered Dialog), `showSheet()` for mobile (bottom sheet). Same content, different shell.
- **Dialog controls**: Quality slider (30-100), max-dimension slider (320 to original long-edge, step 64px, shortcuts: 原始 / 1/2 / 1/4), format option (仅在有 alpha 通道的 PNG 时显示: "保留透明度 PNG" / "转为 JPEG 白色背景").
- **Format detection**: Done in `_openCompressionDialog` via `img.decodeImage()` (pure Dart, no GPU). Detects real pixel transparency (`decoded.hasAlpha && any(px.a < maxChannelValue)`). Result passed to dialog as `hasRealAlpha`. Eliminates separate file header parsing.
- **Compression core**: `ImageCompressor.compressIfNeeded()` in `lib/utils/image_compressor.dart` (credit: Ankairis, PR #705). Decode/encode in background isolate via `compute()`. Parameters: `quality` (1-100), `maxDimension` (resize longest edge, maintain aspect ratio), `keepPng` (override format detection). Defensive: on exception or result≥original, return original path unchanged.
- **File strategy**: Compressed result written to same dir, same basename, new extension (e.g. `photo.png` → `photo.jpg`). Original file deleted. `_images` path updated accordingly.
- **UI**: File size shown as gradient overlay at bottom of each 64×64 thumbnail, with `Lucide.ImageDown` icon. Tappable → opens dialog. `_imageSizes` cache maintained alongside `_images` to avoid repeated disk reads.
- **Compression progress**: Dialog buttons show loading spinner while compressing. Single "压缩" or "全部压缩" (后者仅在 totalImageCount > 1 时可用).

## Sidebar Tip Card

- **Tip**: A short usage hint displayed at the top of the conversations list in the sidebar, in the same slot as the update banner. When an update is available, the update banner takes priority; otherwise a Tip is shown (if enabled).
- **Rotation**: Sequential, persisted via `tip_index_v1` in SharedPreferences. Index advances by 1 on each app cold start (post-frame callback in `main.dart`). User can manually advance via the refresh button on the card.
- **Content**: Finite list of 11 l10n-backed tips (`sideDrawerTip1`–`sideDrawerTip11`). Shipped with the app; no remote fetching.
- **Toggle**: `showTips` in `SettingsProvider` (key `display_show_tips_v1`, default `true`). Located below "Show Updates" in display settings.
- **Widget**: `TipCard` in `lib/features/home/widgets/tip_card.dart`. Same visual style as the update banner (Material rounded-12, `Lucide.Lightbulb` icon, bold title, body text, trailing `Lucide.RefreshCw` button).

## Skill System

### Core Concept

- **Skill**: A directory at `<appData>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` containing a specialized instruction set + optional auxiliary files (scripts/, references/, assets/). The directory name IS the skill's identity — it must match the `name` field in YAML frontmatter and follow AgentSkills naming rules (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; ≤64 chars; no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens).
- **`SkillManager`**: The facade that owns all skill CRUD. Reads SKILL.md from disk lazily — no memory cache. Atomic write pattern: staging dir → rename target→backup → rename staging→target → cleanup. Path safety: rejects names containing `/`, `..`, leading/trailing dots, and whitespace.
- **`AppDirectories.getSkillsDirectory()`**: Returns `<appData>/skills/`. Each skill lives in its own subdirectory matching the skill name.

### Lifecycle

- **Import** (three channels, all funnel to `SkillManager.saveSkill()`):
  - Manual paste: User pastes complete SKILL.md (YAML frontmatter + body) into a text box. Real-time frontmatter parsing + name validation.
  - File picker: System file picker selects a single `.md` file or `.zip` archive. ZIPs are scanned for all `SKILL.md` files (any nesting depth), each validated and imported independently.
  - GitHub URL: v1 not implemented; user can download ZIP and use file picker. If added later, uses GitHub Contents API + `saveSkillFilesAtomically()`.
- **Update**: Re-import with the same name overwrites the directory. Atomic write handles crash safety.
- **Delete**: `SkillManager.deleteSkill(name)` removes the directory. Removes from all assistants' `skillIds` (orphan cleanup).
- **Export**: Included in backup via `_packZipSync` — `skills/` directory packed independently of `includeFiles`, always included. Incremental backup uses mtime ≥ since filtering (same mechanism as upload/avatars/images/fonts).

### System Prompt Injection

- **`<available_skills>`**: An XML block injected into the system prompt listing only the skills the current assistant has bound. Contains `name` + `description` only (progressive disclosure level 1). Excludes disabled or unbound skills.
  ```xml
  <available_skills>
    <skill>
      <name>pdf-processing</name>
      <description>Extract text and tables from PDF files...</description>
    </skill>
  </available_skills>
  ```

### Tool Layer

- **`load_skill`**: A built-in tool exposed to the model (gated by `assistant.skillIds`). Named to mirror `read_memory` (memory 'tool' mode). Parameter `{ name: string }` (required). Returns the SKILL.md Markdown body as plain text. Optional parameters can be added later by extending `properties` without changing `required`.

### Assistant Binding

- **`assistant.skillIds`**: `List<String>` on the `Assistant` model, stored in SQLite as JSON (`skillIdsJson` TEXT column, same pattern as `localToolIdsJson`). Only skills in this list are injected into the assistant's `<available_skills>` and have their `load_skill` tool definition exposed.

### Backup Integration

- `skills/` directory is always included in backup ZIPs — NOT gated by `includeFiles`. Rationale: skill files are small (pure text) and fundamental to assistant behavior. Incremental backup filters by mtime via existing `_addDirectoryToZip(since:)`.
- Restore: `_extractZipSync` decompresses `skills/` entries, preserving mtime from ZIP entry `lastModTime`. `SkillManager` discovers imported skills on next `listSkills()`.

### Relationship to Existing Concepts

- **Skill vs InstructionInjection**: Both provide instructions to the model. **InstructionInjection** follows `memory 'injection'` mode: full prompt is injected into every system message regardless of relevance. **Skill** follows `memory 'tool'` mode: only metadata (name/description) is injected; the model must choose to call `load_skill` to read the full body. This is the key structural distinction — `InstructionInjection : injection mode :: Skill : tool mode`.
- **Skill vs WorldBook**: **WorldBook** entries are triggered by keyword/regex matching against conversation context and injected at specific positions (after system prompt, top of chat, bottom of chat, at depth). **Skill** has no keyword triggering — the model decides based on the `<available_skills>` descriptions.
- **Skill vs LocalTool/MCP**: **LocalTool** and **MCP** are executable tools: model calls them → something happens (read clipboard, execute code). **Skill**'s `load_skill` is a "knowledge tool": model calls it → receives instruction text → nothing executes. Same tool dispatch pathway, different semantics.

### Example Dialogue

> **Dev:** "A user pasted a long workflow prompt into InstructionInjection expecting the model to use it only when working on that specific task. Should this be a Skill instead?"
> **Domain expert:** "Correct. InstructionInjection always injects into every system prompt — it's `memory 'injection'` mode. The model gets that prompt unconditionally, even for unrelated queries. Skill only exposes its name and description in `<available_skills>`; the model reads the full body only when it calls `load_skill`. This way the instruction stays out of context until it's actually needed."

### Flagged Ambiguities

- "skill" was used interchangeably to mean both "a set of instructions loaded from disk" and "an individual step in a model's reasoning process" — resolved: the former is **Skill** (capitalized, bounded in the codebase), the latter falls under general LLM domain language and is not part of Cuplivo's domain model.
